# Backgammon
Backgammon project for Computer Science A-Level Coursework  

I made this backgammon game for my computer science coursework. It features 1 player mode against an easy or hard AI, or a 2 player mode. You can see the [documentation](coursework.pdf) here.  

If you wish to download and play, remember to keep all files and folders relative to their position as they are in the [Coursework folder](/Coursework).
